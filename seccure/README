 
  SECCURE Elliptic Curve Crypto Utility for Reliable Encryption

              http://point-at-infinity.org/seccure/


The SECCURE toolset implements a selection of asymmetric algorithms
based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). See the manpage or the
project's homepage for further details. SECCURE is released under the
GNU General Public License (GPL).

The code links against the GNU gcrypt library "libgcrypt" (which is
part of the GnuPG project). Use the included Makefile to build the
binary.
